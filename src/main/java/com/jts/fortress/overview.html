      <title>Overview of the com.jts.fortress component</title>
   </head>
   <body>
       A standards based and open source Identity Access Management Java SDK for LDAP v3 compliant systems.

      <h2>What can Fortress SDK do?</h2>

       Contained within this SDK are APIs and utilities to perform authentication, authorization, administration audit and password policies.
       The most important package in this system is <A HREF="com/jts/fortress/package-summary.html">com.jts.fortress</A> which contains all of the public APIs that need to be called by outside programs.

      <h2>What technologies are used?</h2>
      <p>
         Fortress SDK runs on any platform that supports Java technology and LDAP v3 protocols.  Functionality that extends beyond
          LDAP v3 is provided via <a href="http://openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</a> specific features.  In other words Fortress was optimized to run on OpenLDAP.
      </p>
      <h2>What are the conditions of use?</h2>
      <p>
         This software development toolkit is open source, thus free to use and distribute via the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause">BSD 3-Clause License</a>.
         It was developed and tested on open systems like <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="http://www.centos.org/">Centos</a> and would not have been possible
         without open source contributions from the following:
          <ol>
          <li><a href="http://www.openldap.org/project/">The OpenLDAP Project</a></li>
          <li><a href="http://www.apache.org/">The Apache Software Foundation</a></li>

          </ol>
      </p>
      <p>
         Check out the <b>com.jts.fortress.samples</b> in the test package for how to use these APIs within Java programs.  The
         <b>dist</b> target in build.xml will create a samples package in the /dist folder of this project.
