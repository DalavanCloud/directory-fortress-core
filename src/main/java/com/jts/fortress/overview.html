       A standards based and open source Identity Access Management Java SDK for LDAP v3 compliant systems.

      <h2>What can Fortress SDK do?</h2>
       Contained within this SDK are APIs and utilities to perform authentication, authorization, administration, audit and password policies.
       The most important package in this system is <A HREF="com/jts/fortress/package-summary.html">com.jts.fortress</A> which contains all of the public APIs that are called by outside programs.

      <h2>What technologies are used?</h2>
      <p>
         Fortress SDK runs on any platform that supports Java technology and LDAP v3 protocols.  Functionality that extends beyond
          LDAP v3 is provided via <a href="http://openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</a> specific features.  In other words Fortress was optimized to run on OpenLDAP.
