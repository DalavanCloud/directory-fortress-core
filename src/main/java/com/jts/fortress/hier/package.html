         This package uses <a href="http://www.jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a> to provide hierarchical functionality that is reused within several other packages in the fortress system.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <b>com.jts.fortress.hier</b> package implements a simple directed graph data structure that is reused across
           the various hierarchical subsystems in this system.  The simple digraph functions utilize a 3rd party open source
          package, see <a href="http://www.jgrapht.org/">JGraphT</a> to provide this capability.  This package also
          provides the ability to store the parent-child relationships in ldap object class <b>oamHier</b>.
          See the corresponding javadoc contained with this package for more info.
