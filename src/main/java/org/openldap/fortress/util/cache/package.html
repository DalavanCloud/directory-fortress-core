      <p>
          This package contains a caching facade used by internal Fortress functions.  Currently this package
          uses <a href="http://ehcache.org//">Ehcache</a> implementation but this can be swapped out for another
          mechanism as needed without disturbing the calling functions.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <b>us.jts.fortress.util.cache</b> package contains utilities to perform caching functions.
