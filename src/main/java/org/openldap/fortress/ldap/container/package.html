         This package contains APIs to perform CRUD on fortress container objects in ldap.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <b>org.openldap.fortress.ldap.container</b> package provides apis to add and
          remove ldap <b>OrganizationalUnit</b> entries.  These entries are called 'containers'
          and are used to organize related fortress nodes.  An example container is <b>ou=People</b> which will be placed as a
          child node of the directory's ldap suffix, i.e. <b>dc=example,dc=com</b>.  The container is used to store subentries, i.e. <b>inetOrgPerson</b>.
          These container APIs are used by buildup/teardown processes.
