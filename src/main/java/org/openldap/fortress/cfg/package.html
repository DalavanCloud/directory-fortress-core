      <p>
         This package uses <a href="http://commons.apache.org/configuration/">Apache Commons Configuration</a> APIs to provide configuration data to fortress along with CRUD APIs for storing config data on the ldap server.
      </p>
      <p>
         The <b>org.openldap.fortress.config</b> can store its data both in a flat file or within the LDAP directory itself.
          The <b>oamConfig.xml</b> contains the location of the bootstrap property file.  The bootstrap properties
          can then point to a remote LDAP configuration node, called a 'realm', and referenced with this property:
          <b>config.realm</b>.  An empty or null value for the config.realm property means the properties will all be stored locally in the file specified within oamConfig.xml.
          The package also contains entities and apis that are used to perform CRUD on remote configuration parameters.
          See the corresponding javadoc contained with this package for more info.
