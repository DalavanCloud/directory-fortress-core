<h2>How do I start using the Fortress?</h2>

<p>

<h3>Check out the <a href="org/apache/directory/fortress/core/doc-files/ten-minute-guide.html">Apache Fortress Ten
    Minute Guide</a></h3>
<h4>Build fortress core, realm, web and rest components from source. Covers tomcat and apacheds server installation and
    configuration.</h4>
Designed to get going with apache fortress software in a short amount of time on Fedora and Debian machines.

<h2>What can Fortress Core SDK do?</h2>
Contained within this SDK are APIs and utilities to perform authentication, authorization, administration, audit and
password policies.
The most important package in this system is <A HREF="org/apache/directory/fortress/core/package-summary.html">org.apache.directory.fortress.core</A>
which contains all of the public APIs that are called by outside programs.

<h3>Fortress Manager APIs</h3>
<ol>
    <li><a href="org/apache/directory/fortress/core/AccessMgr.html">AccessMgr</a> - This class performs runtime access
        control operations on objects that are provisioned <a

    <li><a href="org/apache/directory/fortress/core/AdminMgr.html">AdminMgr</a> - This class performs administrative
        functions to provision Fortress <a

<h2>What technologies are used?</h2>

<p>
    Fortress SDK runs on any platform that supports Java technology and LDAP v3 protocols. Functionality that extends
    beyond
    LDAP v3 is provided via <a href="http://openldap.org/">OpenLDAP</a> or <a
        href="http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/">ApacheDS</a> specific features. In other words Fortress was
    optimized to run on OpenLDAP but works on any directory.

<h2>Where are the coding samples?</h2>

<p>
    The <A HREF="../samples/overview-summary.html">coding samples</A> are located within the <b>org.apache.directory.fortress.core.samples</b>
    package. The samples show how Fortress apis work. The
    ant <b>dist</b> target in build.xml creates the samples package in the /dist folder of this project and is intended
    to be used for experimentation.
