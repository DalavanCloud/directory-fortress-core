      <p>
         This package contains APIs to perform create and teardown the ldap suffix node.
      </p>
      <p>
         Care must be taken when performing the delete api as it is destructive and will attempt to
          recursively remove all nodes below the suffix.  This delete is not intended as safe for
          teardown on large, production data sets.  The delete is safe for teardown of smaller directory as in initial base loads and/or regression
          testing operations.
          The <b>org.apache.directory.fortress.ldap.suffix</b> package provides apis to add and remove suffix node, <b>dcObject</b>.
          The suffix node is also called 'root' or 'baseDn' and is the uppermost node within a particular Directory Information Tree.
          Example of valid suffix nodes is <b>dc=example,dc=com</b>.  The container nodes will be located as direct descendants of the suffix.
